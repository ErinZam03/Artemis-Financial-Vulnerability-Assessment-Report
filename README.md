# Artemis-Financial-Vulnerability-Assessment-Report
Client Summary
Artemis Financial is a consulting firm that specializes in developing personalized financial plans for its clients, which include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance strategies. The company sought to modernize its software operations to ensure the security of its client data. Specifically, Artemis Financial needed to address vulnerabilities within its software to prevent potential security breaches and protect sensitive financial information.

What I Did Well
In the 6-1 Coding Assignment: Modifying Vulnerability Reporting, I successfully identified and documented the critical security vulnerabilities within the Artemis Financial software. This involved a thorough analysis of the existing codebase and the application of secure coding principles to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Coding securely is vital for preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data, ensuring the integrity of client information, and maintaining trust between the company and its clients. The value of software security extends to protecting the company's reputation, reducing the risk of financial loss, and ensuring compliance with industry regulations.

Challenges and Helpful Parts
One of the most challenging aspects of the vulnerability assessment was determining the most effective mitigation techniques for the identified vulnerabilities without compromising the software's functionality. However, this challenge was also a learning opportunity, allowing me to deepen my understanding of the trade-offs between security and usability.

Increasing Layers of Security
To increase the layers of security, I refactored the existing code to incorporate encryption techniques and enforce secure communication protocols. In the future, I would use a combination of automated vulnerability scanning tools and manual code reviews to assess vulnerabilities and decide on the most appropriate mitigation strategies.

Ensuring Functionality and Security
After implementing the necessary security enhancements, I conducted thorough testing to ensure that the code remained functional and that no new vulnerabilities were introduced. This involved running static analysis tools, like OWASP Dependency-Check, and performing manual testing to validate the effectiveness of the security measures.

Useful Resources, Tools, or Practices
Throughout this project, tools like OWASP Dependency-Check and secure coding practices, such as input validation and output encoding, were instrumental in identifying and addressing vulnerabilities. These resources and practices will be invaluable in future assignments and professional tasks, as they provide a solid foundation for building secure software.

Showcasing to Future Employers
From this assignment, I would highlight my ability to identify, document, and mitigate software vulnerabilities effectively. The work completed in this project demonstrates my commitment to software security and my capability to balance security requirements with the need for functional, user-friendly software.
